                This was when Ifechukwu kept disturbing his father and preventing him
                from studying. He made sure he paused the studies and focused on
                taking photos instead.

                Same day as above. He made sure to ruffle my jacket and block my face
                from the camera. A good climber i must say and hope he never gets to
                fall but will always be there to catch him.

                After 12hours of hard physical labor, we still make out time to take a
                few shots and post our records in the sands of time. <br />
                knackered but still looking fly.<br />Thats the goal!

                No time is ever better than spending it with your family and what
                other event is more precious than coming from the house of the Lord
                with cleansed and refreshed spirits. <br />Another historic moment!
